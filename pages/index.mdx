import {OverleafDeployButton} from '@/components/deployToOverleaf'

# Introduction
 
This site hosts all the various diagrams I have made or referenced in latex. Most of them were created by me.

In this site I have added a variety of components such as OverleafDeployButton, which allows you to deploy the tex file to overleaf. This is done by using the texFilePath prop.

<OverleafDeployButton 
    texFilePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FriendlyUser/LatexDiagrams/master/ArtificialIntelligence/can_mis.tex"    
/>
